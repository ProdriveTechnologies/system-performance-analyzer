System Performance Analyser (SPA)
=================================
The SPA tool tests the performance for Linux based systems. This tool contains resource usage measurements and analysis to find bottlenecks in a system. Additionally, thresholds can be configured to check whether application(s) stay within the thresholds. These thresholds can be based on actual requirements of a project.

This tool can execute any Linux application as well as [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) pipelines. For GStreamer pipelines, additional data is measured and extra thresholds can be configured.
